# Computer Vision (CV)

## Master in Artificial Intelligence (MAI) - UB

This repository contains the laboratory exercises for the CV compulsory course. 
Each consists of one or more Python Notebooks with the solution to those exercises.

We provide the executed versions of each Notebook (the ones we delivered), but we have not included the different images required to execute some of them.
